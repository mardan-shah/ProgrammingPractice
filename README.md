# C++ Data Structures Project

![Project Logo](project-logo.png)

## Overview

This C++ project is a collection of various data structures implementations, including linked lists, binary trees, and hash maps. Each data structure is implemented from scratch to provide a better understanding of their underlying concepts and operations.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Linked List**
   - Description: A singly linked list implementation with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - Source File: `linked_list.cpp`

2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Description: A doubly linked list implementation with support for bidirectional traversal.
   - Source File: `doubly_linked_list.cpp`

3. **Binary Search Tree**
   - Description: A binary search tree (BST) implementation with operations like insertion, deletion, and search.
   - Source File: `binary_search_tree.cpp`

4. **Hash Map**
   - Description: A hash map (unordered map) implementation using separate chaining for collision resolution.
   - Source File: `hash_map.cpp`

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory using the command line.
3. Compile the C++ source files using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
4. Run the compiled executable to test the data structure implementations.

## Sample Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "linked_list.cpp"

int main() {
    LinkedList<int> list;

    list.insert(10);
    list.insert(20);
    list.insert(30);

    list.display(); // Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30

    list.remove(20);

    list.display(); // Output: 10 -> 30

    return 0;
}
```
